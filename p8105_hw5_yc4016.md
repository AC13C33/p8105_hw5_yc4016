# Problem 1

### Question

-   Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants,
    including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:
    -   Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files
        function will help
    -   Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
        purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the
        dataframe
    -   Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm
        and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do
        any other tidying that’s necessary
-   Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over
    time, and comment on differences between groups.

# Problem 2

``` r
homicides_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") 
```
